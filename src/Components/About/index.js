            <p>I'm a Full-Stack Developer leveraging a strong background
               in entrepreneurship to put 110% into everything I do and creative thinking
                to find success. Recently earned a certificate in Full-Stack Web Development
                 through The University of Texas at Austin. Newly developed skills in

                    Known as a creative problem-solver with a passion for developing sleek & intuitive
                     web applications. With each project, my goal is to keep my target audience
                      engaged and create recurring users on the site. I have worked effectively on a team
                       multiple times to deliver a project by specific deadlines. Iâ€™m excited to leverage
                        my skills in the industry to develop cutting-edge applications as part
